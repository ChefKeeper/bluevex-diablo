Bluevex is the .net version of Redvex.  It acts as a portal that accepts and sends your packets, both to and from your client, and to and from the battle.net server.  Bluevex's plugins enable you to "cheat" on battle.net, by obtaining advantages, such as automating tasks like logging on automatically, or sending attacks, followed by going hostile and sending a town portal.  There are many advantages to using Bluevex over Redvex, which you will see as more plugins are released over time.  Bluevex is an open source project, written in VB.net, but supports C#, and other .net languages as well.  It is created by Pleh, and the latest version is version beta 4, but beta 5 should be released soon.
